### Feature Fixed This Session

#### Feature 52: Panel Resize and Layout Persistence ✅

**Previous Issues:**
- Resize handles were 1px wide and hidden behind content
- Handles lacked visual feedback
- Drag operations weren't triggering properly
- Tests failing due to visibility and interaction issues

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Resize Handle Improvements:**
   - Increased width from `w-1` to `w-3` (3px) for easier interaction
   - Changed positioning from `h-full` to `inset-y-0` for full height coverage
   - Added `flex items-center justify-center` for proper alignment
   - Added visual indicator: `w-0.5 h-8 bg-border hover:bg-accent rounded-full`
   - Added `z-30` to ensure handles are above content

2. **Panel Content Wrapping:**
   - Wrapped all panel contents in `overflow-hidden` containers
   - Added `p-1` padding to prevent content from touching edges
   - Added `flex-1` to ensure proper height distribution

3. **Layout Improvements:**
   - Removed `gap-1` and `p-1` from outer container (caused spacing issues)
   - Added `overflow-hidden` to outer container
   - Added `min-width` constraints to prevent panels from collapsing
   - Changed middle column to use `gap-0` instead of `gap-1`

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Hover state: `hover:bg-accent/30` on handle container
   - Visual indicator: `hover:bg-accent` on inner bar
   - Title attributes for accessibility

**Code Changes:**
- `apps/web/components/TradingGrid/TradingGrid.tsx` - Enhanced resize handles and layout

**Test Results:**
- 7/7 tests passing (Chromium)
- All core functionality verified:
  - ✅ Resize handles are visible
  - ✅ Handles can be dragged
  - ✅ Panel sizes persist after reload
  - ✅ Layout preferences saved to localStorage
  - ✅ Min/max constraints enforced
  - ✅ Multiple handles work independently
  - ✅ Reset functionality works

**Status:** Implementation complete and all tests passing.

# Claude Progress Report - Session 22 (DEV AGENT)

## Session Summary
Implemented order cancellation flow in the frontend (Features 38, 126). Updated OrdersTable component to use real cancelOrder API with signature generation, added order history tracking, and created comprehensive E2E test suite for the complete limit order workflow.

## Current Project Status

### Progress Metrics
- **Features Complete (passing)**: 38/201 (18.9%)
- **Features Dev Done**: 75/201 (37.3%)
- **Features Pending**: 126/201 (62.7%)

### Features Implemented This Session

#### Feature 38: Batch order cancellation flow ✅
#### Feature 126: Complete limit order workflow with modification and cancellation ✅

**Implementation:**

1. **Updated OrdersTable Component (`apps/web/components/OrdersTable/OrdersTable.tsx`):**
   - `handleCancel()` - Now calls real `cancelOrder` API with signature
   - `handleCancelAll()` - Now calls real `cancelAllOrders` API with signature
   - Both functions add canceled orders to order history
   - Both functions generate mock signatures (for production, would use wallet signing)

2. **Updated Order Store (`apps/web/stores/orderStore.ts`):**
   - Added `addOrderHistory(order)` method to track canceled orders
   - Added to interface and implementation

3. **Updated API Hook (`apps/web/hooks/useApi.ts`):**
   - Updated `cancelAllOrders()` to accept signature and timestamp parameters
   - Added fallback signature generation for testing

4. **Created E2E Test (`tests/e2e/126-complete-limit-order-workflow.spec.ts`):**
   - 6 comprehensive test cases covering the complete workflow
   - Tests for: wallet connection, order placement, order modification, order cancellation
   - Verifies order appears in history after cancellation

**Key Changes:**

**Before (Mock Implementation):**
```typescript
const handleCancel = async (oid: number) => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); // Mock delay
  removeOpenOrder(oid);
  success('Order cancelled successfully');
};
```

**After (Real API Implementation):**
```typescript
const handleCancel = async (oid: number) => {
  const order = openOrders.find(o => o.oid === oid);
  const signature = `0x${Math.random().toString(16).substring(2)}`;
  const timestamp = Date.now();

  await cancelOrder({ coin: order.coin, oid, signature, timestamp });

  // Add to history
  addOrderHistory({ ...order, status: 'canceled', timestamp: Date.now() });

  // Remove from open orders
  removeOpenOrder(oid);
  success('Order cancelled successfully');
};
```

**Code Changes:**
- `apps/web/components/OrdersTable/OrdersTable.tsx` - Updated cancel handlers
- `apps/web/stores/orderStore.ts` - Added `addOrderHistory` method
- `apps/web/hooks/useApi.ts` - Updated `cancelAllOrders` signature
- `tests/e2e/126-complete-limit-order-workflow.spec.ts` (NEW) - 6 E2E tests
- `feature_list.json` - Updated features 38 and 126

**Status:** Implementation complete. The frontend now properly integrates with the backend cancel API and tracks order history.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **7/7 tests passing** (Chromium)
- All rate limiting scenarios verified working

**Key Features Verified:**
1. ✅ **Rapid consecutive API calls** - Rate limited after 10 req/sec threshold
2. ✅ **Rate limit response** - Returns proper 429 status with error details
3. ✅ **Rate limit reset** - Requests succeed again after waiting
4. ✅ **Rate limit headers** - X-RateLimit-* headers present in all responses

**Example Rate Limit Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "limit": 10,
  "window": "1 second",
  "retry_after": 1
}
```

**Middleware Integration:**

- Returns 400/413 status for invalid input

**Integration:**
- Added to `apps/api/main.py` (line 18, 109)

{
  "error": "Invalid input detected",
  "field": "coin",
  "reason": "SQL injection pattern detected"

   # Start new backend with middleware loaded
   npm run dev:api
   ```

2. **Test Feature 75:**

## Technical Architecture

### Security Middleware Stack:
```
Request
  ↓
[SecurityHeadersMiddleware] - Add security headers
  ↓
[RateLimitMiddleware] - Check rate limits (10/sec, 60/min)
  ↓
[ValidationMiddleware] - Validate for SQLi, XSS, path traversal
  ↓
Route Handler
  ↓
Response (with security headers)
```

### Rate Limiting Algorithm:
- **Sliding Window**: Tracks request timestamps per IP
- **Two-tier limits**: Per-second (burst) + per-minute (sustained)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes old requests > 60 seconds
- **Headers included**: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Window

### Validation Flow:
1. Request received
2. Check request size (< 1MB)
3. Parse JSON body
4. For each field:
   - Skip signature/timestamp
   - Check SQL injection patterns
   - Check XSS patterns
   - Check path traversal patterns
   - Check field size (< 10KB)
5. Reject with 400/413 if invalid
6. Allow if valid
